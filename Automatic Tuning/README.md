## <mark><u>Automatic Online Tuning-Of-PI(D) Controllers</u></mark>

Here I analysed 3 papers by Clarke and tried to implement the 2006 Paper.

### Abstract:

This paper introduced a method to autotune our PID controller by injecting multifrequency sine waves. The ultimate aim being to attain a design point on the Nyquist Diagram. These sinewaves were then passed through a phase/frequency estimator and tried to attain a desired phase margin by varying the frequency through an adaptive Algorithm. This method also ensured that we can excercise a constraint over controller parameters, leading to consistent behaviour for a wide variety of generic cases.
